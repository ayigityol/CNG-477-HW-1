#Assignment #1 Simple Ray Tracer
Today we started writing our ray tracer in class. In this first assignment, finish the code we have started by finishing the readScene function and the main function to generate your first simple image for the sample scene provided by using the intersectSphere function provided. To generate ray equations you may use slide 1 of raytracing1.pdf. If a ray for a pixel intersects a sphere assign the color of that sphere directly for that pixel without shading calculations. In other words, in your images the spheres will look like 2D discs (or ellipses). Ignore the light source part of the scene file. The code and the scene file is attached to this assignment and are also available on the weekly resources list. Submit your completed source code as a raytracer.c file and your output for the sample scene as output.ppm.jpg. You may download imagemagick's convert.exe from:

http://www.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~tcan/ceng477/20141/convert.exe

You will also need the following dll in the same directory as convert.exe:

The deadline is next week before class. Submit via ODTU-Class. The assignment should not take much of your time but let me know if you have any questions or problems. 


#Assignment #2: Extending the ray tracer for multiple light sources.
Today we implemented the basic illumination model and shadows in our ray tracer. In this assignment, extend the code we have written today, so that shadows and illumination from multiple light sources are displayed correctly. Submit your completed source code as a raytracer.c file and your output for the new sample scene as output2.ppm.jpg.

The deadline is again next week before class (no late submission since I will discuss the solution in class). Submit via ODTU-Class. The assignment should not take much of your time but let me know if you have any questions or problems.

The code we have written in class and the scene file is attached to this assignment.
